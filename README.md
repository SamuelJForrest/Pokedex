# Pokedex
A Pokedex storing the information of the original 151 Pokemon. Project made with HTML/CSS/JS.

This is my first "completed" HTML/CSS/JS project.

The purpose of this project was to practice DOM manipulation. Originally, this project was intended to only have a select input and two buttons to cycle throught the select. I decided to add in a randomiser button too for an extra challenge.
